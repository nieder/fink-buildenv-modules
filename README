Fink Project Modules for simplifying the building of Fink packages.

These modules are meant to be sourced during a package build in order to 
provide commonly used variables and settings to the build process.  Many 
packaging actions are repetitive and common across packages.  Rather than 
reinventing the wheel every time, a package would source the necessary 
module(s) from this package and apply the provided values as needed.
