# Usage:
# Source this script file within {Patch,Compile,Install,Test}Script in
# your .info file in order to set environment variables calculated for the 
# buildtime system.
#
# These variables can then be used for patch token replacement or in 
# shell conditionals, among other uses, without reinventing the wheel.
# Example 1: Provide the proper SDK location in a patch
#			 Patch any hardcoded SDK locations in the source tree and replace
#				with the string @SDK_PATH@.
#			 In PatchScript, replace the token with the variable containing the 
#			 	SDK location, and apply the patch:
#			 sed "s|@SDK_PATH@|$SDK_PATH|g" < %{PatchFile} | patch -p1
# Example 2: Use in a conditional to determine if a flag is needed
#			 if [ "$OSX_MAJOR_VERSION" >  "10.7" ]; then ...
