# Usage:
# Source this script file within any of {Patch,Compile,Install,Test}Script
# in your .info file in order to set environment variables for use in a 
# cmake based build.
#
# The calculated variables are concatenated as -D defines in $FINK_CMAKE_ARGS.
# Then, you can run cmake like so:
#     cmake $FINK_CMAKE_ARGS .
# If you wish to unset a variable, simply undefine it:
#     cmake $FINK_CMAKE_ARGS -UCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE .
#
# TODO:
# Set up a way to NOT include a variable in FINK_CMAKE_ARGS if passed from the
# command line: eg. . %p/sbin/fink-buildenv-cmake.sh --noset=CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
# would neither define $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX nor add it to $FINK_CMAKE_ARGS.
