General
=======
When a script gets sourced, and it sources fink-buildenv-helper.sh, check 
if fink-buildenv-helper.sh has already been sourced in the parent script.

Establish a system to NOT set a variable via the source command:
eg. . %p/sbin/fink-buildenv-cmake.sh --noset=CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX would 
neither set $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX nor add it to $FINK_CMAKE_ARGS.
